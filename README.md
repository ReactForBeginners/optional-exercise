# Note Taking App 

This exercise is optional. It's intended for students who doesn't want to re-build any of the previous exercises with the new [production workflow](https://github.com/ReactForBeginners/es6-production-workflow), but rather get a completely new exercise together with the new workflow.  

The app you'll create is a basic note taking app, with the features described below.

We do not have any other demands, so the rest is up to you!

## Features

* Creating a new note
* Edit existing notes (either live saving or a 'save' button)
* Deleting notes  

Note: This is a last minute add, so we don't have any suggested solutions for this exercise. Take this as a challenge! And as soon a you have a solution you're pleased with, submit a pull request and we could possibly add it as the suggested one ;)
